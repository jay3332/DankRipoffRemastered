# Getting Started with Coined

Coined is a **global economy system**, meaning that the economy spans throughout Discord and is not limited to a single server. \
In the Coined economy, your goal is to grind your way to the top and obtain the highest stats possible.

## ü§ë Coins

The core currency that Coined revolves around is of course, the **coin**, denoted by the \
<:coin:896432147152400394> emoji. Coins are the "money" of Coined, they have value, and most things in Coined are \
"worth" coins.

## üíµ Wallet and Bank

Your coins are primarily stored in your **wallet** and **bank**.
- Your **wallet** stores *usable coins* that you can spend and immediately use.
- Your **bank** stores *saved coins* that cannot be used until you withdraw them from your wallet.
  - You can store coins in your bank to save them for later, and to protect them from being stolen.
  - Your bank has a limit on how many coins it can store, and gradually increases as you use Coined.
- To view your *balance*, which is an overview of your worth and coins (including wallet and bank), run {{/balance}}.

## üè¶ Bank Transactions

There are two types of bank transactions: **deposits** and **withdrawals**.
- **Deposits** are when you transfer coins from your wallet to your bank. You can deposit coins by running {{/deposit}}.
- **Withdrawals** are when you transfer coins from your bank to your wallet. You can withdraw coins by running {{/withdraw}}.
