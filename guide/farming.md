# The Farming System

## Overview

**Farming** in Coined is a system that allows you to plant crops, water them, and harvest them over time for a passive \
supply of crop harvests.

## Understanding the Land system

- You own a plot of land that you can use to plant crops. You can view your land by running {{/farm view}}. Any patches \
of land with ðŸ”’ (locks) on them are not owned by you yet, and you must purchase them using {{/farm buy}}.
- Each patch of land has a coordinate, which is a letter followed by a number. For example, A1, B2, C3, etc.
- By default, you start with 16 patches of land, coordinates A1 through D4, so you can get started with farming right away.

## Buying and Planting Crops

- You must first have crops in your inventory before you can plant them. You can browse crops in the standard item shop \
by running {{/shop}} and then filtering by the **Crop** category. You can then buy crops by running {{/buy}}.
- Once you have crops in your inventory, you can plant them on your land by running {{/farm plant}}.

## Harvesting Crops

- You can harvest crops and obtain their harvests in your inventory by running {{/harvest}}, which will harvest all \
harvestable crops. Note that crops take time to grow, so you will have to wait a while before you can harvest them.
- You can view the time remaining until a particular crop is ready to harvest with {{/farm info}}.

## What can I do with crop harvests?
