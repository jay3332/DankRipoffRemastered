## How do I get pets?

You can get pets by **hunting** for them via the {{/hunt}} command. 
For a guide on how to hunt, see the guide by clicking on *How do I hunt?* at the bottom of this message. 

## How do pets work?

- View all pets you have collected by running {{/pets all}}.
- View more information on a specific pet by running {{/pets info}}.
- In order for pet boosts/abilities/attacks to activate, you must **equip and feed the pet**.
  - See *Equipping Pets* to learn more about equipping pets.
  - See *Feeding Pets* to learn more about the feeding your pets.

**TL;DR:** {{/hunt}} for pets (*How do I hunt?*), equip them (*Equipping Pets*), then {{/feed}} them (*Feeding Pets*) \
to activate their boosts.
