# Hunting for Pets

You can hunt for pets by running {{/hunt}}.
- Hunting is risk-free and there are no requirements to hunt!
For an introduction to the pet system, see the guide by clicking on *What are Pets?* at the bottom of this message.

## Things to note

- You will be given a 4-by-5 hunting "grid". **The grid will appear blank at first.**
- **After a few seconds,** a pet will spawn in one of the 20 tiles.
- Right as the pet spawns, **click the tile with the pet** to catch it!
  - Clicking too early or on the wrong tile will result in a failed hunt.
  - You will also see a ðŸ’£ **Bomb** on the grid. Do not click this tile!

*View the animation for an example of a hunt.*

## What happens after I hunt?

After a **successful hunt**, the pet you caught will be added to your pet collection.
- You can view your pet collection by running {{/pets all}}.
- You can view more information on the pet you caught by running {{/pets info}}.
- Finally, you must **equip and feed** the pet in order for its boosts/abilities/attacks to activate.
  - See *Equipping Pets* and *Feeding Pets* at the bottom of this message for more information.
- If you get a duplicate pet, its *duplicate count* increases and the pet will get a bit of EXP.
