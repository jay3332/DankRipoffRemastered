# Diving

Diving is a high-risk, high-reward command that can be used to make a large profit. The command is available to use \
via {{/dive}}.

## How to Dive

You can dive by running {{/dive}}, which will take you to an interactive diving game. You will be presented with the \
choice to either **dive deeper** or **surface**.
- If you choose to **dive**, you will dive deeper into the water, and either:
  - find extra coins and items, or
  - encounter some scenario which ends the diving session, causing you to lose everything you've earned, or even die.
- If you choose to **surface**, you will end the diving session, and you will obtain everything you've found during \
the dive.

## Diving Deeper

Diving deeper is how you can find more coins and items while diving. The deeper you dive, the more coins you get and \
the rarer the items you can find.
However, make sure keep track of a few things while diving:
- **Your oxygen level** – If you run out of oxygen, you will die.
- **Change of dying from pressure** – Past 50m, you have a chance of dying from water pressure, and this chance is \
specified in the diving message. Be sure to keep track of this chance, to determine whether it would be wise to continue \
diving.
- **Depth** – Apart from water pressure, the deeper you dive, the higher the chance of encountering a failing scenario \
there is.

**Make sure you have lifesavers when diving!** Death is a very real possibility when diving, and lifesavers are the \
only way to prevent death. Lifesavers can be purchased from the shop via {{/shop}}.
