# Items and Inventory

## What are items and how do I get them?

Items are collectible objects that can be used for various purposes. There are many different types of items, each with \
their own unique properties and uses.

Items can be obtained throughout the Coined economy system in a variety of ways. Some items are common, some are super \
rare, and some are even unobtainable! How many can you collect?

## Buying Items

A very direct way of obtaining items is by buying them from coins. There are many different shops and markets you can \
buy them from, however most items you will buy will be available in the global *item shop*, which you can access by \
running {{/shop}}. When you see an item you want to buy, you can buy it by running {{/buy}}.
