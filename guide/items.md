# Items and Inventory

## What are items and how do I get them?

Items are collectible objects that can be used for various purposes. There are many different types of items, each with \
their own unique properties and uses.

Items can be obtained throughout the Coined economy system in a variety of ways. Some items are common, some are super \
rare, and some are even unobtainable! How many can you collect?

## Buying and Selling Items

A very direct way of obtaining items is by buying them from coins. There are many different shops and markets you can \
buy them from, however most items you will buy will be available in the global *item shop*, which you can access by \
running {{/shop}}. When you see an item you want to buy, you can buy it by running {{/buy}}.

When you want to sell an item in your inventory (usually for coins), you can sell eligible items by running {{/sell}}.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can view more information on a particular item by running {{/shop}} and passing in the *item* argument.

## Using Items

- Some items are also *usable* via {{/use}}. Some are also usable in bulk, whereas some have usage limits.
- Many power-up-style items which are *activated on use* can also be *removed* to remove its effects. You \
can do this by running {{/remove}}.

## Crafting Items

You can craft items by runing {{/craft}}. See *Crafting* for more information.
