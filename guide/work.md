# Work and Jobs

A great way of earning money in Coined is by working by running {{/work start}}. If you've never worked before, \
Coined will guide you in finding a job and starting your first shift.

## Minigames

When working your shift, you will be presented with a **minigame**. There are many different types of minigames, each \
with their own unique mechanics and gameplay.

## Keywords and Phrases

Every job will have its unique set of **keywords** and **phrases**, which could be included in job minigames.
You can view all keywords for a job by running {{/work info}}. Phrases are not accessible directly by the bot since \
there is no advantage to knowing them.

## Work Stats

View your work stats by running {{/work view}}. If you want to find another job, you can quit your current job by \
running {{/work quit}} and then viewing available jobs by running {{/work list}}.

## Getting Raises

Every 5 successful work shifts in a row, you will automatically get a raise and your salary will increase. Note that \
resigning from your job will reset all raises!
