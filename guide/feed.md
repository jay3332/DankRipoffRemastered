# Feeding Pets

## Overview

Pets must also be **fed** in order for their boosts/abilities/attacks to activate.
- Feed pets by running {{/feed}}, which brings an interactive feeding menu.
  - Again, this command is interactiveâ€“it "guides" you through the feeding process.
- Pets must be *equipped* first in order to feed them.
- You can feed pets with a subset of food-like items in your inventory.
  - A good way of maintaining a steady supply of food is with a farm, where you can passively maintain a steady \
supply of food. (See *Farming* at the bottom of this message for more information.)

## Energy

- Your pet will have a certain *energy level* that is replenished by feeding.
  - At zero energy, no boosts/abilities/attacks will activate.
- Your pet will slowly lose energy over time, passively.
  - Active abilities may use extra amounts of energy, so use them sparingly.
- Your pet will also have a *max energy level* which can only be increased by *evolving* the pet.
  - Pet evolution is an in-progress feature as of now.
