# Equipping Pets

Pets must first be **equipped** in order for their boosts/abilities/attacks to activate.
- Equip a pet by running {{/pets equip}}.
  - Similarly, unequip an already-equipped pet by running {{/pets unequip}}.
- If you want to swap an already-equipped pet with another pet, you can use {{/pets swap}} as a shortcut.

## Limits

- You may only eqiup up to three pets at a time.
  - This limit will be upgradable in the future.
- You are limited to 5 *pet swaps* per *2 hours*.
  - Equipping or unequipping a pet counts as *0.5 pet swaps*.
  - Swapping counts as *1 full pet swap*.

## Viewing Equipped Pets

View *equipped pets* by running {{/pets view}}.
